## NYC Arrests (2006 - Dec 2023) | STATUS: `UNFINISHED`
- This project was solely inspired by my wish to live & work in NYC, so I decided to analyze its crime rate in numerous categories including age, race, and gender.
- This project was also motivated by the idea of creating some "Data Engineering" project using pure Java to demonstrate my expertise in the language itself and my personal interests in NYC.
- This project is BY NO MEANS to accuse any age, race, or gender of being violent.
